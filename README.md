# blindpipes-javafx-game

At the first grade of our university journey, along with my teammate Fatih Said Duran, we created this puzzle game as a term project for the CSE1142 course.

JavaFX technology is used for all the animations and GUI properties.

The most noteworthy task was to implement a dynamic approach while checking whether if the current level is completed or not. 

We avoided hardcoding the predefined solution scenario for the given level with if blocks and tried to give our code the ability to work correctly even the input files are completely changed.

Detailed information can be found in the project report.
